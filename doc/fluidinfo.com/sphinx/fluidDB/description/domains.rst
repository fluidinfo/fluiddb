Domains
=======

Fluidinfo usernames can be roughly divided into three use classes:

* **People:** A person might have the Fluidinfo username ``sam`` with
  tags like ``sam/rating`` or ``sam/seen-it``.

* **Applications:** An application might have a username like ``music-maker``
  with tags like ``music-maker/album/title`` and
  ``music-maker/album/artist``.

* **Organizations:** A company will likely want to use a Fluidinfo username
  that matches its internet domain. Amazon could use the Fluidinfo user
  name ``amazon.com`` and put tags like ``amazon.com/price`` and
  ``amazon.com/number-of-stars`` onto Fluidinfo objects.

Referring to this third class, we can informally speak of Fluidinfo *domains*,
understanding that these are just Fluidinfo usernames (i.e., a top-level
:doc:`namespace <namespaces>`) that exactly match a regular internet
domain.


All usernames matching internet domains are reserved
----------------------------------------------------

Usernames matching internet domains are reserved for the owners of the
internet domain. To obtain a Fluidinfo username matching an internet domain
you must be able to prove that you control the domain name. This will be
confirmed via you being able to respond to email sent to the domain and/or
create a specific web page.

Any dispute over a Fluidinfo username corresponding to an internet domain
will be resolved in favor of the domain owner.

Why use a Fluidinfo username matching your internet domain?
-----------------------------------------------------------

The answer is very simple: it will allow your products to be found in new
ways.

A regular internet domain gives a company a way to stamp their name
(via a URL) on entire web pages of information. *Fluidinfo offers a way to
stamp your company name on individual pieces of data.*

Whereas the web gets you a massive audience having the uniform experience
of looking at single mass-audience product web pages, Fluidinfo lets any
application get to products via all sorts of routes that a retailer cannot
anticipate, and which would not be cost effective for them to build. If I
want to see Amazon books that are less than $20 and which have been looked
at by Esther, we can do it, e.g., via easy-to-write Firefox extensions,
assuming Amazon puts their price onto the book object. It's in the interest
of Amazon to do this, because it helps people find their products. Amazon,
and many others, provide an API to get hold of their data - they want
applications to be written which present their products. Putting that data
directly into Fluidinfo makes great sense.

It has never been possible to put individual pieces of data (e.g., a single
price) somewhere *with a domain name on it* so as to let applications (and
hence the people who use them) directly combine them, and augment them, to
find your products in any way *they* like. While the web provides a single
mass-audience user interface to a product, Fluidinfo allows for arbitrarily
many interfaces, and these can be as personalized as you like.

Though a retailer like Amazon has done a good job of trying to personalize
things for you ("people who bought X also bought Y"), that approach is
still mass audience to a large extent. I want to know if my friend
*Russell* or someone I'm connected to on `Goodreads
<http://www.goodreads.com>`_ bought a book, not (only) if some bunch of
anonymous people did, even if those people are, according to Amazon, in
some sense like me.

Fluidinfo opens access to that lower stratum of information personalization,
and correspondingly personalized routes to products. To make it possible
for applications that allow that sort of product access, a company needs to
be able to put its data onto objects in a recognizable way, via a name that
carries reputation, trust, goodwill etc.  Fluidinfo usernames that correspond
to internet domains give you an instant and low-cost mechanism for doing
just that.

Of course applications need to be written to fulfil this potential. Fluidinfo
provides the information platform that makes it possible (simple!) to do so.
