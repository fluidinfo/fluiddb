Overview
========

Fluidinfo is a hosted online storage platform. By "hosted" we mean that
there is a single instance of Fluidinfo, available to any application with
an internet connection. There is nothing to download or install. To use
Fluidinfo, applications make simple HTTP requests.

The main aim of Fluidinfo is to give applications, and the people who use
them, the possibility of sharing, combining, and augmenting each other's
information. The freedom to work with information in this more natural way
is a fundamental property of Fluidinfo. Applications and users do not have to
ask for permission to add data to Fluidinfo, and no one need anticipate their
needs.

Traditional databases, with their tight top-down control, do not provide or
support this kind of flexibility.

Information in context
----------------------

Information becomes more useful, and thus more valuable, when it is stored
*in context* - alongside related information. Wikipedia is the perfect
illustration of this principle. If you know something about New York, for
example, the obvious place to store your information online is in
Wikipedia. There, it will sit beside other information about New York, it
will be seen by many, and it can be enhanced or refined by others.

Wikipedia provides a fully writable environment for *people* to contribute,
share, and augment information. It is extremely flexible and its structure
and organization evolve according to need and utility.

Heart of a wiki?
----------------

Similarly, Fluidinfo provides storage that lets *applications* contribute,
share and augment data. For this reason, and to add a little color, we
sometimes refer to Fluidinfo as having *the heart of a wiki*.

While analogy to a wiki is useful when starting to think about Fluidinfo, and
it is true that Fluidinfo retains the extreme flexibility of a wiki, Fluidinfo
has important fundamental enhancements that make it more appropriate for
use by applications:

* Fluidinfo has a permission system for controlling what can be done
  to information.
* In Fluidinfo, data is typed - numeric, textual, date, binary, etc.
* Fluidinfo provides a query language for search.
* There are no editors who can reject or roll back changes.
