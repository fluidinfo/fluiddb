Advanced Concepts
=================

Here you will find more advanced information about Fluidinfo, and an
introduction to its API.  Before diving into the details of Fluidinfo,
you should be familiar with the `high-level description
<../index.html>`_. You might want to jump straight to the :doc:`http`
for an introduction to using Fluidinfo's API, or if you are already
comfortable with HTTP and `REST <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST>`_
principles, you may want to skip ahead to the `Fluidinfo API
Specification <http://api.fluidinfo.com>`_.
