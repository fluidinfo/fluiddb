Deployment
==========

We use fabric (0.9.2) for automating the deployment of this website.
To deploy the website to the live server, run::

    $ fab live deploy

*NOTE* - You must commit your changes in bzr ***BEFORE*** you deploy the
website.

The above fab command is actually just doing two things:

1) Build the static HTML files from the information in the registry
2) Copy the generated files to the remote server

If something goes wrong in deployment and you need to revert to an
earlier version, it's very simple since each deployment has its own
directory containing the website.

You just need to point the web-server to the old deployment's
directory. E.g.::

    $ rm -f /var/www/api.example.com
    $ ln -s /var/www/PATH_TO_OLD_DEPLOYMENT /var/www/api.example.com
